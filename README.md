# Student Performance Reporting System
**A robust backend REST API service for managing and tracking student academic achievements**

---

## 📖 Overview

The Student Performance Reporting System is a comprehensive backend solution designed to streamline the management of student achievements including competitions, seminars, organizational activities, and other academic accomplishments. Built with scalability and security in mind, it implements a hybrid database architecture combining PostgreSQL's relational integrity with MongoDB's flexible document storage.

### Why This System?

- **Dual-Database Architecture**: Leverages the strengths of both SQL and NoSQL databases
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: JWT authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Workflow Management**: Complete achievement lifecycle from draft to verification
- **Clean Architecture**: Maintainable, testable, and scalable codebase
- **Real-time Analytics**: Comprehensive reporting and statistics

## 🔒 Security

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials via `/api/v1/auth/login`
2. Server validates credentials and generates JWT access token
3. Client includes token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
4. Middleware validates token and extracts user information
5. RBAC middleware checks user permissions for requested resource

### Role-Based Access Control

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **Student (Mahasiswa)** | Create and manage own achievements, view own profile, submit for verification |
| **Lecturer (Dosen Wali)** | Verify/reject advisee achievements, view advisee data and reports |
| **Admin** | Full system access, user management, global statistics, all CRUD operations |

### Security Best Practices

- ✅ Password hashing using bcrypt
- ✅ JWT token expiration and refresh mechanism
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ SQL injection prevention through prepared statements
- ✅ NoSQL injection prevention through driver validation
- ✅ Role-based endpoint protection
- ✅ Soft delete for data recovery
